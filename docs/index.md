# What is Sine?

Sine is a multifunctional discord bot which uses last.fm data to compare users' music taste. 

# Why Sine?

**Why not.**

On a more serious note, Sine is largely a personal project, none of what Sine aims to accomplish is a commercial goal, and I will not be making money from sine. 

**How to get Sine**

Sine is currently under heavy development, as such there may not be a public release for some time, but once a semi-stable beta is made, I will be releasing sine-beta, which will allow you to test functionality and send in bug reports! Patience, young padawan.
